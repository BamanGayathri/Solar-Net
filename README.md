Solar-Net: Leveraging Transformers for Enhanced Solar Power Prediction


Abstract—This paper presents a study of irradiance prediction using a transformer-based machine learning model for the photovoltaic (PV) renewable energy system. We explore the forecast of irradiance using ten years of data from the Texas Mesonet Data Archive at the Reese Center in Lubbock, Texas. After training our transformer model with 90% of the data, we show that it can fit t he i rradiance t rend s uccessfully, w hile t he testing phase with the remaining 10% of the dataset indicates that the transformer can predict irradiance trends that align with the observed values. Additionally, we borrow the concept of rolling LSTMs to generate a rolling transformer in order to extrapolate values of irradiance even when the observed values are not available. Our extrapolation results show that the transformer can extrapolate irradiance values accurately in the short-term, but it is less precise in the long-term. To remedy this, we aim to explore more thoroughly the hyperparameter configuration of our model in order to move towards our goal of including machine learning methods in the control of PV systems.
